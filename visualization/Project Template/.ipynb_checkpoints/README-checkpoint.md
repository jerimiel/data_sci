* The distribution of the age variable shows that the younger generation is more represented by the data than the older
* Even though there are more subscribers than customers, customers have a higher duration on average
* On average, the distance covered by the customers was a bit more than the distance covered by the subscribers
* The most duration spent is the age group 40-60 and the age group 20-40 the least
* The age group greater than 60 and those less than 20, which in a normal population distribution will be considered the children and aged cover the least distances and 20-40 which actually has the least duration covered the most distance.
* Distance increse with increase in duration
* subscribers have the least duration and customers the most duration. The trend of the age groups >60 and < 20 covering the least distance occurs in both cases of customers and subscribers.
